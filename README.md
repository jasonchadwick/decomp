Decomposing arbitrary unitary matrices into multi-controlled CX/CZ gates for neutral atom computers

Mostly based on cosine-sine decomposition, which turns an arbitrary unitary into "uniformly-controlled" one-qubit unitaries. Currently, have not figured out a way to get a better asymptotic scaling than the CNOT method from https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0504100v1
